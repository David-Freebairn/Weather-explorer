core/yield_n.py
================
Target-yield nitrogen budget calculator, replicating the "Howwet+ N
calculations" workbook (N_budget.xlsx).

Design, matching the workbook:
  - The grower/agronomist supplies their own 20/50/80%ile yield estimates
    directly — these are judgement calls, not something the model
    predicts. The app suggests Y20 = 0.6 x mean and Y80 = 1.5 x mean as a
    starting point (the workbook's own rule of thumb), fully overridable.
    Earlier versions derived the 20/80%ile spread from the ratio of
    historical transpiration percentiles (T20/T50, T80/T50), but that
    band came out narrower than real yield variability — transpiration is
    capped by atmospheric demand as much as by water supply, and it can't
    see frost, heat, disease, or waterlogging, all of which widen the
    real-world spread beyond what a water-balance-only model produces.
  - Nitrogen required for that yield/protein combination is computed from
    a standard grain-N budget (grain N% = protein% / 5.7, a wheat
    convention), grossed up by nitrogen use efficiency (NUE).
  - Nitrogen supply blends known and unknown: this season's ACTUAL
    fallow-phase mineralisation (already happened, real weather) plus the
    LONG-TERM MEDIAN in-crop mineralisation (hasn't happened yet, so the
    historical median is the best available estimate) plus starting
    mineral N and fertiliser applied.
  - Optionally, given a grain price and fertiliser cost, the bottom line
    ($/ha grain return, and $/ha extra fertiliser cost to close any N
    deficit) is also budgeted per percentile.

                       in_crop_n_median()
    nue_pct          : nitrogen use efficiency (%) — fraction of supplied
                       N that ends up in the grain; default 50%

    dict keyed by 20/50/80, each {'yield_t_ha', 'n_required', 'n_supply',

    deficit — plus 'grain_return' and 'extra_fert_cost' when grain_price
    and fert_cost_per_kgn are both given.

    Note: this season's actual fallow-phase N mineralisation is
    deliberately NOT added into n_supply here — a soil test taken after
    the fallow (the usual case for start_n) already reflects whatever
    mineralised over it, so summing both would double-count. Fallow
    mineralisation is instead reported separately, as qualitative
    context (low/average/high relative to the historical distribution)
    rather than a number that feeds the budget.
