core/cropwater.py
==================
Continuous soil-water simulation across a fallow period and into a
following crop, built on top of core.waterbalance.daily_water_balance().

Design
------
The underlying engine (core.waterbalance) is crop-agnostic: it just wants
a green cover fraction, a total cover fraction, a root depth (mm) and a
crop factor for each day. This module supplies those daily values by
switching between two sources at the sowing date, and — new — stretches
a template cover curve to fit whatever plant/maturity dates the user
actually picks, rather than assuming a fixed crop duration.

Template stretching
--------------------
A crop cover template (read with core.cover_excel.read_cover_excel) has
some "typical" green-cover growth window baked into its day axis — e.g.
0% until day 121, ramping up, back to 0% by day 289. Real seasons rarely
match that exact window, so `stretch_cover_schedule()` finds the
template's own growth window (first day green cover rises above a small
threshold, to the last day it falls back below it after peaking) and
linearly stretches/compresses just that window to span the user's actual
plant_date -> maturity_date. The result is a new schedule indexed by
calendar-date ordinal, so it can be queried directly with an actual date
via core.cover_excel.get_cover_state() (no change needed to that function
— it already just interpolates against whatever is in `doy`).

  Before plant_date            -> fixed bare-fallow cover (no roots, no
                                   green cover, light residue)
  plant_date .. maturity_date  -> stretched template
  After maturity_date          -> fixed bare-fallow cover (post-harvest)
